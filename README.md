A practical implementation of neural network training and evaluation using TensorFlow.
Description

This notebook demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model using TensorFlow. It covers data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, and performance evaluation. 
The models classify flower images in 5 different classes:
* Daisy
* Tulips
* Sunflowers
* Roses
* Dandelion
  
Contents

The project is organized into the following sections:
* Libraries and functions: contains necessary libraries and a set functions.
* Hyperparameter and architecture research: S
  * Import and split dataset: steps to load and preprocess input data for the model.
  * Model Architecture: Details of the neural network structure implemented in the notebook.
  * Tuning Hyperparamtere with HyperBand: fixed the structure we tune network to investigate the number of neurons to be taken.
* Final Models: Analyzing the performance of the trained models on test data.
* Output of predictions: visualization of the predictions.
* Further test.
